This Power BI dashboard, titled Customer Bike Purchase Insights, delivers a comprehensive and interactive visualization of customer demographics and behavioral patterns influencing bike purchases. It integrates advanced filtering capabilities through slicers for region, gender, occupation, education level, age group, income group, home ownership, and car ownership, allowing users to drill down into specific segments for deeper insights. Key performance indicators include total customers (1,000), total bikes purchased (481), purchase rate (48.10%), average income of buyers (₹57.96K), non-buyers (₹54.87K), and the average age of bike buyers (42.91 years). The report leverages a variety of visual elements—including bar charts, treemaps, line graphs, donut charts, and geo maps—to present a holistic view of purchase trends across gender, marital status, geographic regions, income brackets, and commute distances. Developed using Power BI Desktop with DAX for dynamic calculations and Bing Maps for geospatial visualization.
